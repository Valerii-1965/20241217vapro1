How to create a new repository - explanations

When you enter any repository on GitHub, you will see a list of files that this project contains. Below the file list you will also see the main description of the project (take a look e.g. at the Gulp repository: https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp

This description is the README.md file. Such a file can be created automatically when creating a new repository (only the project title and optional description is inserted), but you can also create it manually at any time. Such a file has the .md extension, which means that its content is written using the MarkDown syntax.

You can add a README file to a repository to communicate important information about your project. A README, along with a repository license, citation file, contribution guidelines, and a code of conduct, communicates expectations for your project and helps you manage contributions.

For more information about providing guidelines for your project, see Adding a code of conduct to your project and Setting up your project for healthy contributions.

A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on:

What the project does
Why the project is useful
How users can get started with the project
Where users can get help with your project
Who maintains and contributes to the project
